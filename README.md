# Yeet

Yeet is Google Meet browser extension that adds the ability to throw (aka [yeet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/yeet)) the side videos from the right to the left (and back). It works with Sidebar and auto-Tile layouts with presentation where the videos are placed on the side.

Yeet will add a button to the standard set of buttons at the top-right of a Meet window. If the current layout doesn't have any side videos, the button will read `Can't Yeet RN`. Otherwise you can click it to toggle the placement of the side videos.
